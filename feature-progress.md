## Architecture Analysis

### Patterns Found
- **Reports Feature Pattern** (@app/controllers/reports.py, @app/controllers/web_reports.py):
  - Separate index controller for main page
  - Web API controller for AJAX data fetching
  - Query class for database operations
  - TypeScript for frontend interactions
  - SCSS for styling

- **Authorization Pattern** (@app/controllers/web_reports.py:86):
  - `web_user('role_administrator')` decorator for admin-only access
  - Role checking via user_is_admin() helper

- **Query Pattern** (@app/queries/report_query.py):
  - Dedicated query classes per entity
  - Use of psycopg with dict_row factory
  - Composable SQL with proper parameterization
  - Efficient filtering with SQL conditions

- **Pagination Pattern** (@app/lib/standard_pagination.py, @app/views/lib/standard-pagination.ts):
  - Server-side pagination with standard_pagination_range
  - Client-side TypeScript pagination component
  - AJAX-based page loading

### Integration Strategy
The user management system will integrate by:
1. Following the Reports feature structure
2. Adding navigation in settings for administrators
3. Using existing pagination patterns
4. Creating efficient indexes on user table columns only
5. Building rich inline filtering UI with Bootstrap

### Dependencies
- Existing UserQuery class (needs extension)
- Standard pagination components
- Bootstrap UI framework
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- PostgreSQL indexes and query optimization

### Risks & Considerations
- **Scale**: Billions of users require careful index design
- **Query Complexity**: Only filter on indexed user table columns
- **UI Responsiveness**: Debounce search inputs, lazy load options
- **Database Load**: Avoid joins, use covering indexes
- **Memory**: Paginate aggressively, limit result sizes

## Technical Decisions Log

### Database Strategy
**Decision**: Filter only on indexed user table columns, no joins
**Reasoning**: Joins with billions of users are prohibitively expensive. All filtering data must come from the user table with proper indexes.

### Index Design
**Decision**: Use GIN indexes for text search, B-tree for exact matches
**Reasoning**: PostgreSQL GIN indexes with trigrams enable fast pattern matching. B-tree indexes optimal for equality and range queries.

### UI Layout
**Decision**: Inline filters at top, not in modal or sidebar
**Reasoning**: Immediate visibility encourages use, reduces clicks, better UX for frequent filtering, follows modern admin panel patterns.

### Search Implementation
**Decision**: Database-level search with trigram indexes
**Reasoning**: PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension provides fuzzy matching, scales to billions of rows, no external dependencies.

### Export Format
**Decision**: Simple comma-separated user IDs instead of CSV
**Reasoning**: Minimal format perfect for scripting, no escaping issues, trivial to parse, smaller file sizes, faster generation.

### Export Strategy
**Decision**: Dual export - client-side (visible) and server-side (all)
**Reasoning**: Client-side instant for small sets, server-side for comprehensive exports, gives admins flexibility.

### Export Limits
**Decision**: Configure max export size in config.py (default 1M)
**Reasoning**: Prevents accidental database overload, predictable memory usage, can be tuned per deployment.

### Pagination Strategy
**Decision**: Fixed page sizes with offset-based pagination
**Reasoning**: Predictable performance, simple implementation, works with complex filters, users understand page numbers.

### Filter State Management
**Decision**: URL parameters for all filter state
**Reasoning**: Enables bookmarking, shareable filter configurations, browser history works, survives page refreshes.

### Visual Design
**Decision**: Color-coded badges and indicators
**Reasoning**: Instant pattern recognition, reduces cognitive load, accessibility with proper ARIA labels, consistent with Bootstrap.

### Role Display Implementation
**Decision**: Reuse existing role translations and star icons from profile view
**Reasoning**: Consistency across the application, no new translation strings needed, future-proof with fallback for unknown roles.

### Deleted User Detection
**Decision**: Use existing user_is_deleted() function from user model
**Reasoning**: Centralized logic for deletion detection, consistent with existing patterns, registered in Jinja2 globals for template access.

### Export Format
**Decision**: Simple string concatenation for JSON array construction
**Reasoning**: Avoids JavaScript number precision issues with large user IDs, most compatible approach, simplest implementation.

### Burst Registration Threshold
**Decision**: Flag IPs with 2+ registrations in 24h (not 10+)
**Reasoning**: More sensitive to potential spam, catches smaller-scale abuse patterns, aligns with typical spam behavior.

## Performance Targets

- **Search Response**: <100ms for text search on billions of rows
- **Filter Application**: <50ms for filter changes
- **Page Load**: <200ms for 100-row page
- **ID Export (visible)**: <10ms for current page
- **ID Export (all)**: <5s for 1M IDs
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ admins simultaneously
- **Database Load**: <10% CPU increase from user management

## UI/UX Principles
