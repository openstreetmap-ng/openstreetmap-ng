- **Performance**: Must handle billions of users with sub-second response times
- **Localization**: Hard-coded English strings for flexibility, reuse existing translations where applicable
- **Placement**: Link in settings navigation near Administrative tasks
- **Query Organization**: User queries in UserQuery file
- **Key Features**:
  - Rich inline filtering UI at the top of the page
  - Multiple simultaneous filters on indexed columns
  - Visual indicators for quick problem identification
  - Efficient database queries with strategic indexing
  - Real-time search with debouncing
  - Smart sorting for common admin tasks
  - Simple user ID export (comma-separated)

## Architecture Analysis

### Patterns Found
- **Reports Feature Pattern** (@app/controllers/reports.py, @app/controllers/web_reports.py):
  - Separate index controller for main page
  - Web API controller for AJAX data fetching
  - Query class for database operations
  - TypeScript for frontend interactions
  - SCSS for styling

- **Authorization Pattern** (@app/controllers/web_reports.py:86):
  - `web_user('role_administrator')` decorator for admin-only access
  - Role checking via user_is_admin() helper

- **Query Pattern** (@app/queries/report_query.py):
  - Dedicated query classes per entity
  - Use of psycopg with dict_row factory
  - Composable SQL with proper parameterization
  - Efficient filtering with SQL conditions

- **Pagination Pattern** (@app/lib/standard_pagination.py, @app/views/lib/standard-pagination.ts):
  - Server-side pagination with standard_pagination_range
  - Client-side TypeScript pagination component
  - AJAX-based page loading

### Integration Strategy
The user management system will integrate by:
1. Following the Reports feature structure
2. Adding navigation in settings for administrators
3. Using existing pagination patterns
4. Creating efficient indexes on user table columns only
5. Building rich inline filtering UI with Bootstrap

### Dependencies
- Existing UserQuery class (needs extension)
- Standard pagination components
- Bootstrap UI framework
- Authentication/authorization middleware
- PostgreSQL indexes and query optimization

### Risks & Considerations
- **Scale**: Billions of users require careful index design
- **Query Complexity**: Only filter on indexed user table columns
- **UI Responsiveness**: Debounce search inputs, lazy load options
- **Database Load**: Avoid joins, use covering indexes
- **Memory**: Paginate aggressively, limit result sizes

      .map(el => el.dataset.userId)
      .join(',');
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(userIds);
  };
  
  // Server-side export (all filtered)
  const exportAll = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/api/web/users/export?' + currentFilters);
    const userIds = await response.text(); // "1,2,3,4,5..."
  };
  ```
- Keyboard shortcuts:

## Technical Decisions Log

### Database Strategy
**Decision**: Filter only on indexed user table columns, no joins
**Reasoning**: Joins with billions of users are prohibitively expensive. All filtering data must come from the user table with proper indexes.

### Index Design
**Decision**: Use GIN indexes for text search, B-tree for exact matches
**Reasoning**: PostgreSQL GIN indexes with trigrams enable fast pattern matching. B-tree indexes optimal for equality and range queries.

### UI Layout
**Decision**: Inline filters at top, not in modal or sidebar
**Reasoning**: Immediate visibility encourages use, reduces clicks, better UX for frequent filtering, follows modern admin panel patterns.

### Search Implementation
**Decision**: Database-level search with trigram indexes
**Reasoning**: PostgreSQL pg_trgm extension provides fuzzy matching, scales to billions of rows, no external dependencies.

### Export Format
**Decision**: Simple comma-separated user IDs instead of CSV
**Reasoning**: Minimal format perfect for scripting, no escaping issues, trivial to parse, smaller file sizes, faster generation.

### Export Strategy
**Decision**: Dual export - client-side (visible) and server-side (all)
**Reasoning**: Client-side instant for small sets, server-side for comprehensive exports, gives admins flexibility.

### Export Limits
**Decision**: Configure max export size in config.py (default 1M)
**Reasoning**: Prevents accidental database overload, predictable memory usage, can be tuned per deployment.

### Pagination Strategy
**Decision**: Fixed page sizes with offset-based pagination
**Reasoning**: Predictable performance, simple implementation, works with complex filters, users understand page numbers.

### Filter State Management
**Decision**: URL parameters for all filter state
**Reasoning**: Enables bookmarking, shareable filter configurations, browser history works, survives page refreshes.

### Visual Design
**Decision**: Color-coded badges and indicators
**Reasoning**: Instant pattern recognition, reduces cognitive load, accessibility with proper ARIA labels, consistent with Bootstrap.

## Performance Targets

- **Search Response**: <100ms for text search on billions of rows
- **Filter Application**: <50ms for filter changes
- **Page Load**: <200ms for 100-row page
- **ID Export (visible)**: <10ms for current page
- **ID Export (all)**: <5s for 1M IDs
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ admins simultaneously
- **Database Load**: <10% CPU increase from user management

## UI/UX Principles

- **Information Density**: Show maximum useful data without clutter
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced filters hidden but accessible
- **Immediate Feedback**: Every action has instant visual response
- **Fault Tolerance**: System remains usable despite errors
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Mobile Responsive**: Core functions work on tablets
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Most important info prominently displayed
- **Consistent Patterns**: Follows existing OSM-NG UI conventions

## Export Implementation Notes

### Client-Side Export (Visible)
```javascript
// Extract IDs from current page
// Copy to clipboard for <1000 IDs
// Download as text file for larger sets
```

### Server-Side Export (All)
```python
# Query with COPY TO for efficiency
# Stream response to avoid memory issues
# Apply USER_EXPORT_LIMIT from config
# Return text/plain with comma-separated IDs
```
