# Admin User Management Interface - Implementation Progress

## Feature Overview
Implement a comprehensive admin interface for managing individual user accounts, providing administrators with complete control over user properties including display name, email, password, roles, and the ability to impersonate users. The interface follows Bootstrap 5 patterns with SCSS styling and TypeScript-powered standard forms for seamless data submission without page reloads.

## Requirements Summary
- Admin-only access with role_administrator requirement
- User loaded by ID in URL (not volatile display name)
- Editable fields: display name, email (with verification toggle), password, roles
- Read-only tabbed interface showing:
  - Connected OAuth accounts (providers)
  - Authorizations (OAuth apps user has authorized)
  - Applications (OAuth apps user owns)
  - Tokens (personal access tokens user created)
- Link to user-specific audit logs
- "Login as user" functionality for admin impersonation
- Standard form submission without page reload
- Role change confirmations via browser alerts
- No new localization strings (reuse existing where possible)
- Native feel matching existing settings panels

## Architecture Analysis

### Patterns Found
- **Settings Structure**: Settings pages extend `app/views/settings/_base.html.jinja` with consistent navigation (@app/views/settings/security.html.jinja)
- **Form Handling**: Standard forms use `configureStandardForm` with API endpoints returning JSON feedback (@app/views/lib/standard-form.ts)
- **Authentication**: Role-based access via `web_user('role_administrator')` decorator (@app/controllers/web_settings_users.py)
- **User Management**: Existing user list at `/settings/users` with pagination and filtering (@app/controllers/settings_users.py)
- **Content Headers**: User info displayed with avatar in headers like reports/diary pages (@app/views/reports/show.html.jinja:29-37)
- **Connected Accounts UI**: Table-based display with service icons (@app/views/settings/connections.html.jinja:10-42)

### Integration Strategy
The feature will integrate as a new route `/settings/users/{id}` extending the existing user management system. It will:
- Follow the settings page layout pattern with navigation sidebar
- Use standard forms for all data modifications
- Leverage existing user service methods where possible
- Connect to the audit system for user-specific logs
- Implement session manipulation for "login as" functionality

### Dependencies
- User model and roles system (@app/models/db/user.py)
- Standard form library (@app/views/lib/standard-form.ts)
- Auth context for session management (@app/lib/auth_context.py)
- Audit query system (@app/queries/audit_query.py)
- Connected accounts queries (@app/queries/connected_account_query.py)
- Password hashing utilities (@app/lib/password_hash.py)

### Risks & Considerations
- **Security**: "Login as" feature requires careful session handling to prevent security issues
- **Validation**: Email changes without verification need special handling
- **Audit Trail**: All admin actions must be properly logged
- **Role Changes**: Must handle edge cases like admin removing their own admin role
- **Session Management**: Consider impact on active user sessions when changing credentials

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Routes and Core Services - COMPLETED

**Objectives:**
- Create API endpoint for fetching user details ✓
- Implement service methods for admin user modifications ✓
- Add audit logging for all admin actions (deferred)
- Create "login as user" functionality ✓

**Implementation:**
- Created @app/controllers/settings_user_edit.py - Page controller that fetches user data with parallel TaskGroup queries
- Created @app/controllers/web_settings_user_edit.py - API endpoints for user updates and login-as functionality
- Extended @app/services/user_service.py:456-498 - Added `admin_update_user` method using SQL composition
- Session replacement via SystemAppService for impersonation

**Key Decisions:**
- Used TaskGroup for parallel data fetching (connected accounts, authorizations, applications, tokens)
- Single update endpoint handles all fields with optional parameters
- Password update includes `password_updated_at = statement_timestamp()`
- Validating types used in controller, base types in service layer
- Audit logging deferred to later phase per project requirements

**Success Criteria Met:**
- GET `/settings/users/{id}` returns user edit page with all tab data ✓
- POST `/api/web/settings/users/{id}/update` handles all user modifications ✓
- POST `/api/web/settings/users/{id}/login-as` creates new session and redirects ✓

### Phase 2: Frontend Template and Layout - COMPLETED

**Objectives:**
- Create user edit page with Bootstrap 5 layout ✓
- Display user header with avatar and basic info ✓
- Structure form sections for different user properties ✓
- Add navigation and breadcrumbs ✓

**Implementation:**
- Created @app/views/settings/users/edit.html.jinja - Comprehensive template with tabbed navigation
- Extended '_base' template (not 'settings/_base') for admin pages per project conventions
- Implemented user header with avatar, display name, member since date, and roles badges
- Added breadcrumb navigation with aria-current="page" for accessibility
- Created tabbed interface for Account settings, Connected accounts, Authorizations, Applications, and Tokens

**Key Decisions:**
- No new localization strings - reused existing translations and hardcoded English for admin features
- Used time elements with datetime attributes for automatic browser locale rendering
- Connected accounts styled to match existing design with service provider icons
- Form fields include placeholders showing current values
- Password fields left blank to maintain current password if unchanged
- Checkboxes for roles and email verification status

**Success Criteria Met:**
- Page renders with correct user information ✓
- Layout matches existing admin pages (not settings pages) ✓
- All form elements properly structured with Bootstrap 5 ✓
- Responsive design with proper breakpoints ✓

### Phase 3: Form Implementation with TypeScript - PENDING

**Objectives:**
- Configure standard forms for each editable section
- Implement role change confirmation dialogs
- Add real-time validation feedback
- Handle success/error responses

**Approach:**
- Create `app/views/settings/users/edit.ts` for form logic
- Use `configureStandardForm` for each form section
- Add confirmation dialogs for sensitive actions
- Implement client-side validation where appropriate
- Handle API responses with appropriate user feedback

**Success Criteria:**
- Forms submit without page reload
- Validation feedback appears inline
- Role changes show confirmation dialog
- Success/error messages display correctly

### Phase 4: Tabbed Navigation for User Data - PENDING

**Objectives:**
- Create tabbed navigation for different user data views
- Query and display connected OAuth accounts
- Query and display authorized OAuth applications
- Query and display owned OAuth applications
- Query and display personal access tokens

**Approach:**

- Query data via existing queries:
  - `ConnectedAccountQuery` for OAuth providers
  - `OAuth2TokenQuery` for authorizations
  - `OAuth2ApplicationQuery` for owned apps
  - Personal access tokens query
- Create read-only views for each tab
- Reuse existing translations and UI components

**Success Criteria:**

### Phase 5: Login As User Implementation - PENDING

**Objectives:**
- Implement secure session replacement
- Create new session for target user
- Redirect admin to homepage as impersonated user
- Log appropriate audit events

**Approach:**
- Add "Login as user" button in page header
- Create dedicated API endpoint for impersonation
- Replace current session with new user session
- Audit both logout and login events
- Clear admin session and create user session

**Success Criteria:**
- Admin can successfully impersonate user
- Session properly replaced (not stacked)
- Audit trail shows impersonation event
- Admin must re-authenticate to regain admin access

### Phase 6: Styling and Polish - PENDING

- Ensure mobile responsiveness
- Test with various data states

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual consistency with existing settings pages
- Smooth transitions and loading states
- Responsive on all screen sizes
- Accessible keyboard navigation

## Technical Decisions Log

### Form Structure
**Decision**: Use separate forms for each section (password, email, roles) rather than one large form
**Reasoning**: Allows independent validation and submission, reduces complexity, matches existing patterns in settings pages

### Session Management for Impersonation
**Decision**: Replace session entirely rather than stack/nest sessions
**Reasoning**: Simpler implementation, clearer security model, forces admin to re-authenticate for admin access

### Role Change Confirmations
**Decision**: Use native browser `confirm()` for role change warnings
**Reasoning**: Simple, accessible, doesn't require additional UI libraries, appropriate for admin interface

### No New Localization
**Decision**: Hard-code English strings for admin-only features, reuse existing translations where applicable
**Reasoning**: Reduces translation burden on community, admin interface doesn't need localization, follows project guidance

### Audit Integration
**Decision**: Link to filtered audit page rather than embed audit log
**Reasoning**: Reuses existing audit interface, keeps user edit page focused, maintains separation of concerns

### Password Change Method
**Decision**: Admin sets new password directly without knowing old password
**Reasoning**: Administrative override capability, matches expected admin permissions, simpler than password reset flow
