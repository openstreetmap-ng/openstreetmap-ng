> /feat:start is running… Bootstrap 5 project with SCSS. With the recent adition of users management page, the task now is to implement intuitive and complete controls for managing specific user accounts by 
the admin. The user page should also
have a link to the audit log for that specific user. The specific user page is loaded by /id/ in the url and not the display name that is volatile. This is only accessible to the admin role, and    
provides great interface that feel just in place and native to the site. This interface allow changing the user's display name, allows to change the email address without verification, mark the email as
verified/unverified (checkbox), set a new password, and manage roles (list of checkboxes). This interface makes use of standard form to submit data without reload and allow better TS integration. When  
toggling a role there is always a confirming alert that (native browser alert) that requires user to confirm the action. Standard form can provide feedback to the whole form, or individual elements.
There's also a list of active connected accounts providers (facebook, google, etc.) that looks very similar to the existing connected accounts interface in the settings for quick look with useful information 
around it. Only connected are shown and no actions are possible so it's read-only view. Please explore existing settings pannels and stylesheets to get the feel of the project. There's also
a button that lets the admin login as that user, that then replaces current session with that user (bypassing any auth) and redirect to the main / page. To get back, admin will need to log out and log in 
manually. I think the user information like avatar and name (linked) could be put in the content header like app/views/reports/show.html.jinja or app/views/diary/index.html.jinja

✻ Thinking…

  I need to research the codebase to understand:
  1. How the users management page is currently implemented
  2. How settings panels work in the project
  3. The standard form implementation pattern
  4. Authentication and role management patterns
  5. Audit log integration
  6. Connected accounts display patterns
  7. How reports/diary pages use content headers

  Let me start by exploring the project structure and finding relevant patterns.

● I'll research the codebase to understand existing patterns and create a comprehensive implementation plan for the user account management interface.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to research and plan an admin user management page feature for OpenStreetMap-NG. This is a research and planning phase only - I should NOT implement any code, just create a comprehensive 
  feature-progress.md file.

  Key requirements from the user:
  1. Admin-only user management page for specific user accounts
  2. Access via /id/ in URL (not display name)
  3. Features:
    - Change display name
    - Change email without verification
    - Mark email as verified/unverified (checkbox)
    - Set new password
    - Manage roles (checkboxes with confirmation alerts)
    - View connected accounts (read-only)
    - "Login as user" button
  4. Should use standard forms for better TS integration
  5. Link to audit log for that specific user
  6. User info (avatar, name) in content header like existing pages

  I need to:
  1. Research existing patterns in the codebase
  2. Look at existing settings panels and stylesheets
  3. Understand how forms, auth, and user management currently work
  4. Create a detailed planning document

  Let me start by exploring the codebase to understand the existing patterns.

> One last detail, internal pages like this user edit interface primarily don't use localization, there's no need to put community localization efforts on it. But for common strings like Display name input 
  labels or something similar, you can use existing localization strings. In other words, never add new localization for internal pages but feel free to use existing one.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is providing an important clarification about localization strategy for internal admin pages. They want me to:
  1. Not create new localization strings for admin/internal pages
  2. But reuse existing localization strings where appropriate (like "Display name" labels)
  3. This reduces the burden on community translators for admin-only features

  This is a good detail to incorporate into the feature-progress.md document I'm creating. Let me continue with creating the comprehensive implementation plan now.

● Understood! I'll incorporate that localization strategy into the implementation plan - no new localization strings for internal admin pages, but reusing existing ones where appropriate.

  Let me now create the comprehensive feature-progress.md document based on my research:

     # Admin User Management Interface - Implementation Progress
     ## Feature Overview
     Implement a comprehensive admin interface for managing individual user accounts, providing administrators with complete control over user properties including display name, email, password, roles, and
      the ability to impersonate users. The interface follows Bootstrap 5 patterns with SCSS styling and TypeScript-powered standard forms for seamless data submission without page reloads.
     ## Requirements Summary
     - Admin-only access with role_administrator requirement
     - User loaded by ID in URL (not volatile display name)
     - Editable fields: display name, email (with verification toggle), password, roles
     - Read-only view of connected OAuth accounts

✻ Thinking…

  The document has been successfully created. Now I need to mark the final task as completed.

✻ Thinking…

  I've successfully completed all the research and planning tasks, and created a comprehensive feature-progress.md document that outlines the implementation plan for the admin user management interface.

  The document includes:
  1. Feature overview and requirements
  2. Architecture analysis with references to existing patterns
  3. Six implementation phases, each with clear objectives and success criteria
  4. Technical decisions log explaining key architectural choices
  5. Consideration for the localization strategy (no new strings for admin pages)

  All phases are marked as PENDING as per the instructions, ready for implementation in subsequent sessions.

● I've completed the research and created a comprehensive feature-progress.md document with the implementation plan for the admin user management interface. The plan includes:

  6 Implementation Phases:
  1. Backend Routes and Core Services - API endpoints and admin modification methods
  2. Frontend Template and Layout - Bootstrap 5 page structure with user header
  3. Form Implementation with TypeScript - Standard forms with role confirmations
  4. Connected Accounts Display - Read-only OAuth provider list
  5. Login As User Implementation - Session replacement for impersonation
  6. Styling and Polish - SCSS styling matching existing patterns

  The plan incorporates your localization guidance (no new strings for admin pages) and follows the project's existing patterns for settings pages, standard forms, and audit logging. Each phase has clear
  objectives and success criteria to guide implementation.

✻ Thinking…

  Looking at the feature-progress.md, I need to implement Phase 1: Backend Routes and Core Services. This phase includes:

  1. Create API endpoint for fetching user details
  2. Implement service methods for admin user modifications  
  3. Add audit logging for all admin actions
  4. Create "login as user" functionality

  Let me explore the codebase more thoroughly to understand the patterns and what needs to be implemented.

  First, I should understand:
  - How existing user management controllers work
  - How services are structured for user modifications
  - How audit logging is done
  - How session management works for login

  Let me start implementing Phase 1.

● I'll implement Phase 1: Backend Routes and Core Services. Let me first explore the codebase more thoroughly to understand the existing patterns and dependencies.

  Based on my research, I now have a comprehensive understanding of the patterns needed to implement Phase 1. Here's my implementation plan:

  Implementation Plan for Phase 1

  Files to Create/Modify:

  1. Create app/controllers/settings_user_edit.py - Route for rendering the user edit page
    - GET /settings/users/{user_id} - Render user edit page
  2. Create app/controllers/web_settings_user_edit.py - API endpoints for user modifications
    - POST /api/web/settings/users/{user_id}/display-name - Update display name
    - POST /api/web/settings/users/{user_id}/email - Update email and verification status
    - POST /api/web/settings/users/{user_id}/password - Set new password
    - POST /api/web/settings/users/{user_id}/roles - Update roles
    - POST /api/web/settings/users/{user_id}/impersonate - Login as user
  3. Extend app/services/user_service.py - Add admin modification methods
    - admin_update_display_name()
    - admin_update_email()
    - admin_set_password()
    - admin_update_roles()
    - admin_impersonate()
  4. Update audit types - Will need to check if new audit types are needed

  Let me start the implementation.

> Do not integrate audit for now.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is telling me not to integrate audit for now. I should proceed with implementing the backend routes and services without adding audit logging. Let me continue with the implementation of Phase 1.

  Based on my research, I need to:
  1. Create a controller for the user edit page route
  2. Create API endpoints for user modifications
  3. Add admin user modification methods to UserService
  4. Implement the "login as user" functionality

  Let me start implementing these components.

> I think the update should a single method for all fields, so when the form is saved, all display_name, email, verified, roles are updated. Passowrd is updated when something was set in the input field and

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants a single update method that handles all fields at once (display_name, email, email_verified, roles, and optionally password). This matches better with how forms typically work - one submit for
   all changes. Password should only be updated if provided, and password repeat validation will be handled client-side like in the existing security settings.

  Let me also fix the type issue - I need to cast PositiveInt to UserId.

> Hmm I think it would be even safer to apply this update if provided logic also to display name and email. So they only change when something was input, otherwise current value is previewed as a

  The user wants:

  2. Roles should be passed as a list, not individual boolean parameters
  3. Remove the auth cookie parameter from login-as endpoint

> This empty input won't really work for checkboxes like email verified/roles.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is right - checkboxes will always send a value (true/false for single checkbox, present/absent for checkbox groups). We can't use None to detect "not changed" for these fields. We need to always 
  handle them as provided values.

  So the approach should be:
  - display_name and email: optional, only update if provided (not empty string)
  - email_verified: always provided as bool
  - roles: always provided as list (empty list means no roles)
  - new_password: optional, only update if provided

● You're right. Checkboxes will always send values. Let me fix that - checkboxes should always be processed, while text inputs can be optional.
