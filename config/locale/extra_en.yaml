    description: |-
      Here you can manage all your OAuth 2.0 applications.
      These applications can integrate external services, access specific data, or automate tasks.

  my_tokens:
    title: My tokens
    description: |-
      Personal access tokens provide a simple way to authenticate API requests.
      They're ideal for personal projects and when you don't need full OAuth authorization flow.
      Remember, these tokens provide access to your account, so keep them secure and private.
    how_to_use:
      title: Using your tokens
      description: |-
        Once you've created a token and generated its secret, you can use it to authenticate API requests.
        Include the token in the Authorization header using the Bearer authentication scheme.
        Remember to keep your tokens secure. They provide access to your account, so treat them like passwords.
